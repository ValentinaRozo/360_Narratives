# 360_Narratives
**360_Narratives** is a research-oriented application designed to evaluate **gaze direction** when users watch 360° videos. This tool helps analyze how users distribute their attention across the spherical visual field, enabling the assessment of different **filming techniques** used in immersive media formats.

Understanding where users look during a 360° narrative experience can reveal which visual elements attract attention and how narrative structure, composition, and camera positioning impact user engagement.
